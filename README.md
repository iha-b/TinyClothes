# TinyClothes

This project focuses on performing various analytics on a dataset from a clothing company using R and SQL. The aim is to extract meaningful insights related to clothing items, employees, sales, and overall company performance. Through data manipulation and visualization, this project highlights trends and metrics crucial for strategic decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze various aspects of the clothing company's operations, including sales performance, employee contributions, and inventory management.
- **Visualization**: Create visual representations of data trends and key metrics for easy interpretation and reporting.
- **SQL Queries**: Utilize SQL for efficient data retrieval and manipulation, allowing for in-depth analysis of the dataset.
- **R Scripts**: Implement R scripts for advanced statistical analysis and visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **R**: For data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.
- **SQL**: For querying and managing the dataset.
- **R Packages**: Such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr` for data handling and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various attributes related to:
- Clothing items (e.g., type, price, category, stock levels)
- Employee information (e.g., role, performance metrics, sales contributions)
- Sales data (e.g., transaction dates, amounts, customer demographics)

## Usage

1. **Run SQL Queries**: Use the SQL scripts provided to extract relevant data from the database.
2. **Analyze Data**: Run the R scripts to perform analytics on the clothing items and employees.
3. **Visualize Results**: Generate plots and charts to visualize trends and insights derived from the data.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of the analyses performed:

- **Sales Performance by Clothing Item**: Analyzed sales data to determine the top-selling items and their contribution to overall revenue.
- **Employee Performance Metrics**: Evaluated employee sales performance to identify top performers and training needs.
- **Inventory Analysis**: Assessed stock levels of various clothing items to inform inventory management strategies.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive analysis of a clothing companyâ€™s operations, providing valuable insights that can drive decision-making and enhance performance. Future work could include implementing machine learning techniques to predict sales trends and optimize inventory.
